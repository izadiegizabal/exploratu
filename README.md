## Summary

Just point at the prices and watch the exchange besides the original currency üì∏üí≤. It uses your camera and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology to extract the original price, it converts into your desired foreign money and shows the resulting price using AR (Augmented Reality) next to the original amount.

Exploratu provides rates for 147 currencies, updated daily, for updated and accurate exchange rates. Nevertheless, it still allows going offline and being able to use it on those well-deserved vacations! ‚úà‚òÄüèñüòé‚úå

The different currency and foreign exchanges can be easily searched using their name, the country where they are used, symbol and others. It even includes an automatic detector for making this step even easier!
